# Spotify Playlist Creator

This project uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to build a website that allows users to:  
- Search for songs in Spotify's library.  
- Create a custom playlist.  
- Save the playlist directly to their Spotify account.  

## About the Project  

This project is part of my learning journey to improve my skills in React and working with API integrations. Through this project, I aim to gain hands-on experience in building interactive applications and understanding how to handle data from external APIs like Spotify's.  

## Features  

1. **Song Search**: Find songs in Spotifyâ€™s library using keywords.  
2. **Playlist Creation**: Add songs to a custom playlist.  
3. **Playlist Saving**: Save your playlist directly to your Spotify account.  

## Getting Started  

1. Access the website and grant the requested permissions to connect with your Spotify account.  
2. Search for the songs you want to add to your playlist.  
3. Name your playlist and save it to your Spotify account with a single click.  

## Notes  

- A Spotify account is required to use this application.  
- The connection to your Spotify account is handled securely via OAuth.  

Enjoy managing your playlists!
